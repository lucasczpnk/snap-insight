## 2–3 sentence description of the problem you solved
- Users frequently receive CSV datasets but must inspect columns manually, guess data types, write queries, and configure dashboards before they can extract insights, which creates significant onboarding friction. Snap Insight eliminates this by compressing the entire process into a single interaction: upload a file and instantly get automatic schema documentation and visual dashboards, with zero configuration required.
